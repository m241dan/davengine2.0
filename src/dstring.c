/*******************************************************************
 * The Davenge String Library, written by Daniel R. Koris          *
 *******************************************************************
 * This library uses a monitoring system to track strings and      *
 * and their reach making sure not to free a string while          *
 * something is stil using it. It also allows you to get away from *
 * having to know the exact size of a string because it will       *
 * handle memory allocation and deallocation. It is designed to be *
 * used in conjunction with the string.h lib that ships with gcc   *
